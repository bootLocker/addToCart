Hello poor souls who inherit my code.

Just a heads up, i only have 4 actual pieces of data in my db and have commented out the rest. I did this because I had to go back and manually select high quality images of the shoes after realizing I had only grabbed small images and didn't feel like doing it for all of them. I also have a bug found in my colorways.jsx in the front end that after a click on a new colorways shoe and switching between its views, the next time you choose a different colorway, it will not change main shoe image, only the alterior views found below it.

Otherwise, there shouldn't be any other issues besides some css. Feel free to reach out if you're running into serious errors. (:
